description: 'Joy! is a permanent state, a permanent state that arrives with us when we are born. This Joy state will leave with us when leave this world. Therefore, like Buddhists I believe this joy state is eternal and a party of our consciousness. This also means it was not born and therefore cannot die. It cannot be damaged, wounded, hurt or killed.'

# Living, Loving and Joy!
![Joy! Is energy and energy is Joy!](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bf844c5f-3980-4635-aba3-3ba0c23d937e.jpg)

Joy! is a permanent state, a permanent state that arrives with us when we are born. This Joy state will leave with us when leave this world. Therefore, like Buddhists I believe this joy state is eternal and a party of our consciousness. This also means it was not born and therefore cannot die. It cannot be damaged, wounded, hurt or killed.

> This awareness in and of itself can raise our consciousness.

Joy! is also energy, fuel for growth. Fuel for the pursuit of making a difference in the face of adversity. The energy of Joy! fuels our focus, our present moment awareness.

Joy! is energy. Energy is Joy! Follow your Joy! Trust your heart and what excites you. This where your bliss lives.
